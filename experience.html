							<br>
							I was able to work the summers of 2021 and 2022 at BMO Harris Bank virtually.
							I held the positions of Business Analyst and Software Developer. Both times, I
							was a part of their Business Banking Express(BBX) Website Development team.
							<br>
							This was a very beneficial experience as I was able to get real world experience as
							a part of a scrum team. The majority of my days consistented of daily-stand-up and
							code review in the morning. After that I would work on my assignments or attend any other
							meetings I had. The majority of my software work was centered around data management. Various parts
							of their website would send data to external vendors, and I played a role in ensuring it was assigned
							to the correct variables and sent correctly, then also making sure we received and managed the data correctly.
							I also assisted with testing the website in various ways.
							<br>
							Outside of BBX I was also involved with a team of interns.
							The first summer, our task was to build a dashboard for LTOs based on project data. We gathered the data from the various
							teams under each LTO and then built the dashboard with Power BI.
							The second summer, we were tasked with the creation of an idea management platform for the company.
							We began developing our own website while also meeting with external vendors for demos. Eventually,
							we settled on an external vendor and then were responsible for delegating their workflow.

							In the summer of 2020 I worked at the Harbor Lights Restaurant as a busboy.
							It was a job that required me to develop great communication skills. I was a part
							of a team in a very high stress work environment, especially during COVID.

							In the summers of 2018 and 2019 I volunteered at the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Reservation
							in South Dakota. I lived on the reservation and spent my days running a summer camp for the kids.
							It was a very uncomfortable situation at first as it put me very out of my element, but eventually
							I was able to find my rhythm. I made many lifelong friends on the reservation and will never forget
							my time there or what it taught me.
